        <p>Yo Jesse,</p>

        <p>Listen up. We’re about to make a batch that’ll blow everyone’s mind. No more half measures. This batch has to be perfect, no mistakes. Every step needs to be done exactly as I tell you, or the whole thing falls apart. This is more than just product – it’s about power, control, and making our names known. You and I, we’re not just cooking meth anymore. We’re building an empire, and this is the one that will change the game. Every move, every decision from now on matters.</p>

        <p>Make sure to follow the instructions precisely. Bring all the equipment I mentioned, and we’ll meet at the usual place. Also, I found something interesting: "<strong>AlCNa_TCFh1d</strong>". It may look random, but it's not. You're smart, you'll figure it out.</p>

        <p>Instructions for the lab:</p>
        <pre class="code">Gb trg gur frpbaq cneg bs gur yvar, lbh arrq gb ernq: 316e5f706c34316e5f656d61696c5f.</pre>

        <p class="warning">Don't screw this up, Jesse! The rest of the flag is hidden in plain sight:</p>
        <pre class="code">fore%5Fch4ll3ng3%7D.</pre>
