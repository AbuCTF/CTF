Yo Jesse,

Listen up. We’re about to make a batch that’ll blow everyone’s mind. No more half measures. This batch has to be perfect, no mistakes. Every step needs to be done exactly as I tell you, or the whole thing falls apart. This is more than just product – it’s about power, control, and making our names known. You and I, we’re not just cooking meth anymore. We’re building an empire, and this is the one that will change the game. Every move, every decision from now on matters. We’ve already made some noise, but if we pull this off, no one will be able to touch us.

Make sure to bring everything I told you. The methylamine is crucial this time – if we don’t have enough, we’ll have to improvise, and I don’t want to take any risks. Get the equipment ready, and be at the lab at midnight sharp. Time is ticking, and we can’t afford delays. Remember, the purity of this batch has to be higher than anything we’ve made before. This is 99.1%, Jesse. This is our legacy. And if you mess this up, it’s all over for both of us.

I hope you’re up for the challenge because I won’t accept anything less than perfection. The formula is ready. We just need to execute. We’re about to break bad on a whole new level, and this time, there’s no going back. I’ll see you at the lab.

- Walter

P.S. Don’t forget to review the last set of instructions I sent you. Everything depends on precision. One small mistake, and it all falls apart. We’ve got one shot at this. No excuses.
