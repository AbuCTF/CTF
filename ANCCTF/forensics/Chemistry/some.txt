Yo Jesse,

Listen up. Weâre about to make a batch thatâll blow everyoneâs mind. No more half measures. This batch has to be perfect, no mistakes. Every step needs to be done exactly as I tell you, or the whole thing falls apart. This is more than just product â itâs about power, control, and making our names known. You and I, weâre not just cooking meth anymore. Weâre building an empire, and this is the one that will change the game. Every move, every decision from now on matters. Weâve already made some noise, but if we pull this off, no one will be able to touch us.

Make sure to bring everything I told you. The methylamine is crucial this time â if we donât have enough, weâll have to improvise, and I donât want to take any risks. Get the equipment ready, and be at the lab at midnight sharp. Time is ticking, and we canât afford delays. Remember, the purity of this batch has to be higher than anything weâve made before. This is 99.1%, Jesse. This is our legacy. And if you mess this up, itâs all over for both of us.

I hope youâre up for the challenge because I wonât accept anything less than perfection. The formula is ready. We just need to execute. Weâre about to break bad on a whole new level, and this time, thereâs no going back. Iâll see you at the lab.

- Walter

P.S. Donât forget to review the last set of instructions I sent you. Everything depends on precision. One small mistake, and it all falls apart. Weâve got one shot at this. No excuses.
