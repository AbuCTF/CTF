NORMA ANDERSON,&#160;ET&#160;AL.&#160;<br/>
ON WRIT OF&#160;CERTIORARI&#160;TO THE SUPREME COURT&#160;<br/>
OF COLORADO&#160;<br/>
[March&#160;4, 2024]&#160;<br/>
PER&#160;CURIAM.&#160;<br/>A group of&#160;Colorado voters contends that&#160;Section 3 of the<br/>
Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution&#160;prohibits for-<br/>mer President Donald J. Trump, who seeks the&#160;Presidential&#160;<br/>nomination&#160;of the Republican Party in this&#160;year’s election,<br/>from becoming President again.&#160;&#160;The Colorado Supreme&#160;<br/>Court agreed with&#160;that&#160;contention. &#160;It ordered the Colorado&#160;<br/>secretary of state to exclude the former President from the<br/>Republican primary ballot in the State and to disregard any&#160;<br/>write-in votes that Colorado voters might cast for him.&#160;<br/>
Former President Trump challenges that decision&#160;on sev-<br/>
eral grounds.&#160;&#160;Because&#160;the Constitution makes Congress,&#160;<br/>rather than&#160;the States, responsible for enforcing Section 3&#160;<br/>against federal officeholders and candidates, we reverse.&#160;<br/>
I&#160;<br/>
Last September, about&#160;six months&#160;before the March 5,&#160;<br/>
2024, Colorado primary election, four Republican and two&#160;<br/>unaffiliated&#160;Colorado voters filed a petition against former&#160;<br/>President Trump and Colorado&#160;Secretary of State Jena<br/>Griswold in Colorado state court. &#160;These voters—whom we&#160;<br/>refer to as&#160;the respondents—contend that&#160;after former&#160;<br/>

<i>v.</i>&#160;ANDERSON&#160;<br/>
Per Curiam&#160;<br/>
President Trump’s defeat in the 2020 Presidential election,&#160;<br/>he disrupted the peaceful transfer of power by intentionally&#160;<br/>organizing&#160;and inciting the crowd that breached&#160;the Capitol&#160;<br/>as Congress met to certify the election results on January<br/>6, 2021.&#160;&#160;One consequence of those actions, the respondents&#160;<br/>maintain, is that former President Trump is&#160;constitution-<br/>ally ineligible to serve as&#160;President again.&#160;<br/>
Their theory turns on Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amend-<br/>
ment.&#160;&#160;Section 3 provides:&#160;<br/>
“No person&#160;shall be&#160;a Senator or Representative in Con-<br/>gress, or elector of President and Vice President, or<br/>hold any office, civil&#160;or military, under the&#160;United&#160;<br/>States, or under any State,&#160;who, having previously&#160;<br/>taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as&#160;an officer&#160;<br/>of the United States, or&#160;as a member of any&#160;State leg-<br/>islature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any&#160;<br/>State, to support the Constitution&#160;of the United States,<br/>shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion&#160;against&#160;<br/>the same,&#160;or given aid or comfort to the enemies<br/>thereof.&#160;&#160;But Congress may by a&#160;vote of two-thirds of<br/>each House, remove such disability.”&#160;<br/>
According to&#160;the respondents,&#160;Section 3 applies to the for-<br/>
mer President because&#160;after taking&#160;the Presidential oath in&#160;<br/>2017, he intentionally incited the&#160;breaching of&#160;the Capitol&#160;<br/>on January 6 in&#160;order to&#160;retain power. &#160;They&#160;claim that&#160;he<br/>is therefore not a qualified candidate, and that as a result,<br/>the Colorado secretary of state may not place him on the<br/>primary ballot. &#160;See Colo. Rev. Stat. §§1–1–113(1), 1–4–<br/>1101(1), 1–4–1201, 1–4–1203(2)(a), 1–4–1204 (2023).&#160;<br/>
After a five-day trial, the state District Court found that<br/>
former President Trump had “engaged in insurrection”<br/>within the meaning of&#160;Section 3, but nonetheless denied the&#160;<br/>respondents’ petition.&#160;&#160;The court held that Section 3 did not&#160;<br/>apply because the Presidency, which Section 3 does not&#160;<br/>mention by&#160;name,&#160;is not an “office&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;under the United&#160;<br/>

States” and&#160;the President is not an “officer of the United&#160;<br/>States”&#160;within the meaning of that provision. &#160;See App.&#160;to&#160;<br/>Pet. for Cert. 184a–284a.&#160;<br/>
In December, the Colorado Supreme Court reversed in&#160;<br/>
part and&#160;affirmed in part by&#160;a 4&#160;to&#160;3 vote.&#160;&#160;Reversing the&#160;<br/>District&#160;Court’s operative holding, the majority&#160;concluded&#160;<br/>that for purposes of Section 3, the Presidency is an office<br/>under the&#160;United States and the&#160;President is an officer&#160;of&#160;<br/>the United States.&#160;&#160;The court otherwise affirmed, holding<br/>(1)&#160;that the Colorado&#160;Election&#160;Code permitted&#160;the respond-<br/>ents’ challenge based on Section 3; (2) that Congress need&#160;<br/>not pass implementing&#160;legislation&#160;for disqualifications un-<br/>der Section 3 to attach; (3) that the political&#160;question doc-<br/>trine did not preclude judicial review of former President<br/>Trump’s eligibility; (4)&#160;that the District Court did&#160;not&#160;abuse&#160;<br/>its discretion in admitting into evidence portions of a con-<br/>gressional&#160;Report on the events&#160;of January 6; (5) that the&#160;<br/>District&#160;Court did not err in concluding that&#160;those events<br/>constituted&#160;an “insurrection” and that former President&#160;<br/>Trump&#160;“engaged in”&#160;that insurrection; and (6) that former<br/>President Trump’s speech to the crowd that&#160;breached the&#160;<br/>Capitol on January 6 was not protected by the&#160;First Amend-<br/>ment.&#160;&#160;See&#160;<i>id.</i>, at 1a–114a.&#160;<br/>
The Colorado Supreme Court accordingly ordered Secre-<br/>
tary&#160;Griswold not to “list President Trump’s&#160;name on the&#160;<br/>2024 presidential primary ballot” or “count any write-in<br/>votes cast for him.” &#160;<i>Id.</i>, at 114a.&#160;&#160;Chief Justice Boatright&#160;<br/>and Justices Samour and Berkenkotter each filed dissent-<br/>ing opinions. &#160;<i>Id.</i>, at 115a–124a, 125a–161a, 162a–183a.&#160;<br/>
Under the terms of the&#160;opinion of the Colorado&#160;Supreme<br/>
Court, its ruling was&#160;automatically stayed pending this<br/>Court’s review. &#160;See&#160;<i>id.</i>,&#160;at 114a. &#160;We granted former Presi-<br/>dent Trump’s petition&#160;for certiorari, which&#160;raised a single&#160;<br/>question: “Did the&#160;Colorado Supreme Court&#160;err in ordering<br/>President Trump excluded from the 2024 presidential pri-<br/>mary ballot?”&#160;&#160;See 601&#160;U.&#160;S. ___ (2024). &#160;Concluding that it&#160;<br/>

did, we now reverse.&#160;<br/>

A&#160;<br/>
Proposed by Congress in 1866 and&#160;ratified by the States<br/>
in 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment “expand[ed] federal<br/>power at the expense of state autonomy” and&#160;thus “funda-<br/>mentally altered the balance of&#160;state and federal power&#160;<br/>struck&#160;by&#160;the Constitution.” &#160;<i>Seminole Tribe of&#160;Fla.</i>&#160;v.&#160;<i>Flor-<br/>ida</i>, 517 U.&#160;S. 44, 59 (1996); see also&#160;<i>Ex parte Virginia</i>, 100&#160;<br/>U.&#160;S. 339, 345 (1880).&#160;&#160;Section 1 of&#160;the Amendment, for in-<br/>stance, bars the States from “depriv[ing] any person of life,&#160;<br/>liberty, or property, without due process of law” or<br/>“deny[ing]&#160;to any person .&#160;.&#160;. the equal protection of the<br/>laws.”&#160;&#160;And Section 5 confers&#160;on Congress “power to enforce”&#160;<br/>those prohibitions, along with the&#160;other provisions of the&#160;<br/>Amendment, “by appropriate legislation.”&#160;<br/>
Section 3 of the Amendment likewise restricts state au-<br/>
tonomy, but through different means. &#160;It was designed&#160;to<br/>help ensure an enduring Union by&#160;preventing&#160;former Con-<br/>federates from returning to power&#160;in the aftermath of the&#160;<br/>Civil War.&#160;&#160;See,&#160;<i>e.g.</i>, Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess.,<br/>2544 (1866) (statement of Rep. Stevens, warning that&#160;with-<br/>out appropriate constitutional&#160;reforms “yelling secession-<br/>ists and hissing copperheads” would take seats in the&#160;<br/>House);&#160;<i>id.</i>, at 2768 (statement of&#160;Sen. Howard, lamenting&#160;<br/>prospect of&#160;a “State Legislature .&#160;.&#160;. made up entirely of dis-<br/>loyal elements” absent a disqualification provision).&#160;&#160;Sec-<br/>tion 3 aimed to prevent such a resurgence by&#160;barring from<br/>office “those who, having once&#160;taken an oath to&#160;support&#160;the&#160;<br/>Constitution of the United States, afterward&#160;went into re-<br/>bellion against the Government of the United States.”&#160;<br/>Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 1st Sess.,&#160;626 (1869) (statement of&#160;<br/>Sen. Trumbull).<br/>
Section 3 works by imposing on certain individuals a pre-<br/>
ventive and severe penalty—disqualification from holding&#160;<br/>

a wide array of offices—rather than by granting rights&#160;to<br/>all.&#160;&#160;It is therefore necessary, as Chief Justice Chase con-<br/>cluded and the Colorado Supreme&#160;Court itself recognized,&#160;<br/>to “&#160;‘ascertain[] what particular individuals are embraced’&#160;”&#160;<br/>by the provision.&#160; App. to Pet. for&#160;Cert. 53a (quoting&#160;<i>Grif-<br/>fin’s Case</i>, 11 F.&#160;Cas. 7,&#160;26 (No. 5,815) (CC Va. 1869) (Chase,<br/>Circuit Justice)).&#160;&#160;Chase went on to explain that “[t]o accom-<br/>plish this ascertainment and ensure effective results, pro-<br/>ceedings, evidence, decisions, and enforcements of deci-<br/>sions, more or less formal, are indispensable.”&#160;&#160;<i>Id.</i>, at 26.&#160;<br/>For its part, the Colorado Supreme Court also concluded&#160;<br/>that there must be some kind&#160;of&#160;“determination” that Sec-<br/>tion 3 applies to a particular person “before the disqualifi-<br/>cation holds&#160;meaning.” &#160;App. to Pet.&#160;for Cert. 53a.&#160;<br/>
The Constitution empowers Congress to prescribe how&#160;<br/>
those determinations should be made. &#160;The relevant provi-<br/>sion is Section 5, which enables Congress, subject of course<br/>to judicial review, to pass “appropriate legislation” to “en-<br/>force” the Fourteenth Amendment. &#160;See&#160;<i>City&#160;of Boerne</i>&#160;v.&#160;<br/><i>Flores</i>, 521&#160;U.&#160;S. 507, 536 (1997). &#160;Or as&#160;Senator Howard&#160;<br/>put it at the time the&#160;Amendment was framed, Section 5<br/>“casts upon Congress the responsibility of seeing to it, for&#160;<br/>the future,&#160;that all the sections of the amendment are car-<br/>ried out in&#160;good faith.” &#160;Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess.,<br/>at 2768.&#160;<br/>
Congress’s&#160;Section 5 power is critical when it comes to<br/>
Section 3.&#160;&#160;Indeed, during a debate&#160;on enforcement legisla-<br/>tion less&#160;than a year after ratification, Sen. Trumbull noted&#160;<br/>that “notwithstanding [Section 3]&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. hundreds of men&#160;<br/>[were] holding office” in violation of&#160;its terms. &#160;Cong. Globe,<br/>41st Cong.,&#160;1st Sess., at 626. &#160;The Constitution, Trumbull&#160;<br/>noted, “provide[d] no means&#160;for enforcing” the disqualifica-<br/>tion, necessitating a “bill to give effect to the fundamental&#160;<br/>law embraced in the Constitution.”&#160;&#160;<i>Ibid.</i>&#160; The&#160;enforcement&#160;<br/>mechanism Trumbull championed was later enacted as<br/>part of the&#160;Enforcement Act of 1870, “pursuant to the power&#160;<br/>

conferred by §5 of the [Fourteenth] Amendment.”&#160;&#160;<i>General&#160;<br/>Building Contractors Assn.,&#160;Inc.</i>&#160;v.&#160;<i>Pennsylvania</i>, 458 U.&#160;S.&#160;<br/>375, 385 (1982); see 16&#160;Stat. 143–144.&#160;<br/>
B&#160;<br/>
This case raises the question whether the States, in addi-<br/>
tion to Congress, may also enforce Section 3. &#160;We conclude&#160;<br/>that States&#160;may disqualify persons holding or attempting&#160;<br/>to hold&#160;<i>state&#160;&#160;</i>office.&#160;&#160;But States have no power under the&#160;<br/>Constitution to enforce Section&#160;3 with respect&#160;to federal of-<br/>fices, especially the Presidency.&#160;<br/>
“In our federal system, the National Government pos-<br/>
sesses only&#160;limited powers; the States and the&#160;people retain&#160;<br/>the remainder.”&#160;&#160;<i>Bond</i>&#160;v.&#160;<i>United&#160;States</i>, 572&#160;U.&#160;S. 844, 854&#160;<br/>(2014).&#160;&#160;Among those retained powers is the power of&#160;a&#160;<br/>State to “order the processes of&#160;its own governance.” &#160;<i>Alden&#160;<br/></i>v.&#160;&#160;<i>Maine</i>, 527 U.&#160;S. 706, 752 (1999). &#160;In particular, the<br/>States enjoy sovereign “power to&#160;prescribe the qualifica-<br/>tions of their own officers” and “the&#160;manner of their election&#160;<br/>.&#160;.&#160;. free from external interference, except so&#160;far as plainly<br/>provided by the Constitution of the&#160;United States.” &#160;<i>Taylor&#160;<br/></i>v.&#160;<i>Beckham</i>, 178 U.&#160;S.&#160;548, 570–571 (1900). &#160;Although the<br/>Fourteenth Amendment restricts&#160;state power, nothing in it&#160;<br/>plainly withdraws from&#160;the States this traditional author-<br/>ity.&#160;&#160;And after ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment,&#160;<br/>States used this authority to&#160;disqualify state officers in ac-<br/>cordance with state statutes.&#160;&#160;See,&#160;<i>e.g.</i>,&#160;<i>Worthy</i>&#160;v.&#160;<i>Barrett</i>,&#160;<br/>63 N.&#160;C. 199, 200, 204&#160;(1869) (elected county sheriff&#160;);&#160;<i>State&#160;<br/>ex rel.&#160;Sandlin</i>&#160;v.&#160;<i>Watkins</i>, 21 La. Ann. 631, 631–633 (1869)<br/>(state judge).&#160;<br/>
Such power&#160;over governance,&#160;however, does not&#160;extend to&#160;<br/>
<i>federal&#160;</i>officeholders and candidates. &#160;Because&#160;federal offic-<br/>ers “&#160;‘owe their existence and functions to the united voice&#160;<br/>of the whole, not of&#160;a&#160;portion, of the people,’” powers over<br/>their election and qualifications must be specifically “dele-<br/>gated to, rather than reserved by,&#160;the States.” &#160;<i>U. S.&#160;Term&#160;</i><br/>

<i>Limits, Inc.</i>&#160;v.&#160;<i>Thornton</i>, 514 U.&#160;S. 779, 803–804 (1995)&#160;<br/>(quoting 1&#160;J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution&#160;of<br/>the United&#160;States §627, p.&#160;435 (3d&#160;ed. 1858)). &#160;But nothing&#160;<br/>in the Constitution delegates to&#160;the States any power to en-<br/>force Section 3 against&#160;federal&#160;officeholders and candidates.&#160;<br/>
As an initial matter,&#160;not even the respondents contend<br/>
that the Constitution authorizes States to somehow remove&#160;<br/><i>sitting</i>&#160;federal officeholders who may be violating Section 3.&#160;<br/>Such a power would flout the principle that “the Constitu-<br/>tion guarantees ‘the entire independence of the General<br/>Government from any&#160;control by&#160;the respective States.’&#160;”&#160;<br/><i>Trump</i>&#160;v.&#160;<i>Vance</i>, 591 U.&#160;S. 786, 800&#160;(2020) (quoting&#160;<i>Farmers&#160;<br/>and Mechanics Sav. Bank of Minneapolis</i>&#160;v.&#160;<i>Minnesota</i>,&#160;232&#160;<br/>U.&#160;S. 516, 521 (1914)).&#160;&#160;Indeed, consistent with that princi-<br/>ple, States lack&#160;even the lesser powers to issue writs of<br/>mandamus against federal officials or to grant habeas cor-<br/>pus relief to&#160;persons in federal custody.&#160;&#160;See&#160;<i>McClung</i>&#160;v.&#160;<br/><i>Silliman</i>, 6 Wheat. 598, 603–605&#160;(1821);&#160;<i>Tarble’s Case</i>, 13&#160;<br/>Wall. 397, 405–410 (1872).&#160;<br/>
The respondents nonetheless maintain that&#160;States may&#160;<br/>
enforce Section 3 against&#160;<i>candidates&#160;</i>for federal office.&#160;&#160;But&#160;<br/>the text of&#160;the Fourteenth Amendment, on its face, does not&#160;<br/>affirmatively delegate&#160;such a power to the States. &#160;The&#160;<br/>terms of the Amendment speak&#160;only to enforcement by Con-<br/>gress, which enjoys power to enforce the&#160;Amendment&#160;<br/>through legislation pursuant to Section 5.<br/>
This can hardly&#160;come as a surprise, given that the sub-<br/>
stantive provisions&#160;of the Amendment “embody significant&#160;<br/>limitations&#160;on state authority.” &#160;<i>Fitzpatrick</i>&#160;v.&#160;<i>Bitzer</i>, 427&#160;<br/>U.&#160;S. 445, 456 (1976).&#160;&#160;Under the Amendment, States can-<br/>not abridge privileges or immunities, deprive persons of<br/>life, liberty,&#160;or property without&#160;due process, deny equal<br/>protection, or deny male inhabitants the right&#160;to vote (with-<br/>out thereby&#160;suffering reduced representation in the&#160;House).&#160;<br/>See Amdt. 14, §§1,&#160;2. &#160;On the other hand, the Fourteenth&#160;<br/>Amendment grants new power to&#160;Congress to enforce the&#160;<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=8></a>8&#160;TRUMP&#160;<br/>
<i>v.</i>&#160;ANDERSON&#160;<br/>
Per Curiam&#160;<br/>
provisions of&#160;the Amendment against the States. &#160;It would&#160;<br/>be incongruous to read this particular Amendment as<br/>granting the States the power—silently no less—to disqual-<br/>ify a candidate for federal office.<br/>
The only other plausible constitutional sources of such a<br/>
delegation are the Elections and&#160;Electors Clauses, which&#160;<br/>authorize States to conduct and&#160;regulate congressional and<br/>Presidential elections,&#160;respectively. &#160;See Art. I, §4, cl.&#160;1;&#160;<br/>Art. II,&#160;&#160;§1,&#160;&#160;cl. 2.1&#160;&#160;But there is little reason to think that&#160;<br/>these Clauses implicitly authorize&#160;the States to enforce Sec-<br/>tion 3 against federal officeholders&#160;and candidates. &#160;Grant-<br/>ing the States that authority would invert the&#160;Fourteenth&#160;<br/>Amendment’s rebalancing of federal and state power.<br/>
The text of Section 3 reinforces these conclusions.&#160;&#160;Its fi-<br/>
nal sentence empowers Congress to “remove”&#160;any Section 3<br/>“disability”&#160;by a two-thirds vote&#160;of each house. &#160;The text im-<br/>poses no limits on that&#160;power, and Congress may exercise it<br/>any time, as the respondents concede.&#160;&#160;See Brief for Re-<br/>spondents 50.&#160;&#160;In fact, historically, Congress sometimes ex-<br/>ercised this amnesty power postelection to ensure that&#160;<br/>some of&#160;the&#160;people’s chosen candidates could take&#160;office.2&#160;<br/>But if&#160;States&#160;were free&#160;to enforce Section 3 by&#160;barring&#160;can-<br/>didates from running in the first place, Congress would be&#160;<br/>

1&#160;The Elections Clause directs, in relevant part, that “[t]he Times,&#160;<br/>
Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representa-<br/>

2&#160;Shortly&#160;after&#160;the Fourteenth Amendment&#160;was&#160;ratified, for instance,&#160;<br/>
Congress enacted a private bill to remove the Section 3 disability of Nel-<br/>
son Tift of&#160;Georgia,&#160;who&#160;had&#160;recently&#160;been&#160;elected to&#160;represent the State<br/>
in&#160;Congress. &#160;See ch. 393, 15 Stat. 427. &#160;Tift took his seat in&#160;Congress&#160;<br/>immediately thereafter. &#160;See Cong. Globe,&#160;40th Cong.,&#160;2d Sess., 4499–&#160;<br/>
4500 (1868). &#160;Congress similarly&#160;acted postelection to remove&#160;the disa-<br/>
bilities of&#160;persons elected to&#160;state and local&#160;offices. &#160;See Cong. Globe, 40th<br/>Cong., 3d Sess., 29–30, 120–121 (1868); ch. 5, 15 Stat. 435–436.&#160;<br/>

forced to exercise its disability removal power before voting<br/>begins if it&#160;wished for its decision to&#160;have any&#160;effect on the<br/>current election cycle.&#160;&#160;Perhaps&#160;a State may burden con-<br/>gressional authority in such a way&#160;when it exercises its “ex-<br/>clusive” sovereign power over its own state offices. &#160;<i>Taylor</i>,&#160;<br/>178 U.&#160;S., at&#160;571. &#160;But it&#160;is implausible to suppose that the&#160;<br/>Constitution affirmatively delegated to the States the au-<br/>thority&#160;to impose such a burden&#160;on congressional power&#160;<br/>with respect to candidates&#160;for federal office. &#160;Cf.&#160;<i>McCulloch&#160;<br/></i>v.&#160;&#160;<i>Maryland</i>, 4 Wheat. 316, 436&#160;(1819) (“States have&#160;no&#160;<br/>power .&#160;.&#160;. to retard, impede, burden, or in any&#160;manner con-<br/>trol, the operations of&#160;the constitutional laws&#160;enacted by<br/>Congress”).<br/>
Nor have the respondents identified&#160;any tradition of state<br/>
enforcement of Section 3 against&#160;federal officeholders or&#160;<br/>candidates&#160;in the years following ratification of the Four-<br/>teenth Amendment.3&#160; Such a lack&#160;of&#160;historical precedent is&#160;<br/>generally a&#160;“&#160;‘telling indication’&#160;” of&#160;a “&#160;‘severe constitutional<br/>problem’&#160;” with the asserted power. &#160;<i>United States</i>&#160;v.&#160;<i>Texas</i>,&#160;<br/>599 U.&#160;S. 670, 677 (2023) (quoting&#160;<i>Free&#160;Enterprise&#160;Fund</i>&#160;v.&#160;<br/><i>Public Company Accounting&#160;Oversight&#160;Bd.</i>, 561 U.&#160;S. 477,&#160;<br/>505 (2010)).&#160; And it is&#160;an especially&#160;telling sign here, be-<br/>cause as noted, States&#160;<i>did</i>&#160;disqualify persons from holding<br/>state offices following ratification of the Fourteenth Amend-<br/>ment.&#160;&#160;That pattern of disqualification with respect to state,<br/>but not federal offices&#160;provides “persuasive evidence of&#160;a&#160;<br/>general understanding” that the States lacked enforcement<br/>power with&#160;respect to the latter. &#160;<i>U.&#160;S.

3&#160;We are aware of just one example of state enforcement against&#160;a&#160;<br/>
would-be&#160;federal officer. &#160;In&#160;1868,&#160;the Governor&#160;of Georgia&#160;refused to&#160;<br/>commission&#160;John&#160;Christy,&#160;who had won the&#160;most votes in&#160;a&#160;congressional&#160;<br/>
election, because—in the&#160;Governor’s view—Section&#160;3 made Christy inel-<br/>
igible to serve.&#160;&#160;But the Governor’s&#160;determination was&#160;not final; a&#160;com-<br/>mittee of the&#160;House reviewed Christy’s qualifications itself and recom-<br/>
mended that he not be seated.&#160;&#160;The&#160;full&#160;House never&#160;acted&#160;on the matter,&#160;<br/>
and Christy&#160;was never&#160;seated.&#160; See 1&#160;A. Hinds, Precedents of the House&#160;<br/>of Representatives §459, pp. 470–472 (1907).&#160;<br/>

Instead, it is Congress&#160;that has long given effect to Sec-<br/>
tion 3 with respect to&#160;would-be&#160;or&#160;existing federal office-<br/>holders.&#160;&#160;Shortly after ratification of&#160;the Amendment, Con-<br/>gress enacted the Enforcement Act of 1870.&#160;&#160;That Act&#160;<br/>authorized federal district attorneys to bring civil actions in&#160;<br/>federal court to&#160;remove anyone holding nonlegislative of-<br/>fice—federal or state—in violation&#160;of Section&#160;3, and made&#160;<br/>holding or attempting to hold office in violation&#160;of Section 3&#160;<br/>a federal crime.&#160;&#160;§§14,&#160;15, 16 Stat.&#160;143–144 (repealed, 35<br/>Stat. 1153–1154, 62 Stat. 992–993). &#160;In the&#160;years following<br/>ratification, the House and Senate exercised their unique<br/>powers under Article I&#160;to adjudicate challenges contending<br/>that certain prospective&#160;or sitting&#160;Members could not take<br/>or retain their seats due to Section&#160;3.&#160; See&#160;Art.&#160;I,&#160;§5,&#160;cls.&#160;1,&#160;<br/>2; 1 A. Hinds, Precedents of the&#160;House of Representatives&#160;<br/>§§459–463,&#160;pp.&#160;470–486 (1907). &#160;And the Confiscation Act&#160;<br/>of 1862, which predated Section 3, effectively provided an<br/>additional procedure for enforcing disqualification.&#160;&#160;That&#160;<br/>law made&#160;engaging in insurrection or&#160;rebellion,&#160;among&#160;<br/>other acts,&#160;a federal crime punishable by disqualification<br/>from holding office under the United States. &#160;See §§2, 3,&#160;12&#160;<br/>Stat. 590.&#160;&#160;A successor to those provisions remains on&#160;the&#160;<br/>books today.&#160;&#160;See 18 U. S. C. §2383.<br/>
Moreover, permitting state enforcement of Section 3&#160;<br/>
against federal officeholders and candidates would raise se-<br/>rious questions about the scope of&#160;that power. &#160;Section&#160;5&#160;<br/>limits&#160;<i>congressional</i>&#160;legislation&#160;enforcing Section 3, because&#160;<br/>Section 5 is strictly&#160;“remedial.” &#160;<i>City of Boerne</i>, 521 U.&#160;S.,&#160;at&#160;<br/>520.&#160;&#160;To comply with that limitation, Congress “must tailor<br/>its legislative scheme to remedying or preventing” the spe-<br/>cific conduct the relevant provision prohibits. &#160;<i>Florida Pre-<br/>paid Postsecondary Ed.

taking a qualifying oath and then&#160;engaging in insurrection<br/>or rebellion—nothing&#160;more.&#160;&#160;Any congressional&#160;legislation<br/>enforcing Section 3 must, like the&#160;Enforcement Act of 1870&#160;<br/>and §2383,&#160;reflect “congruence&#160;and proportionality” be-<br/>tween preventing or remedying&#160;that conduct “and&#160;the&#160;<br/>means adopted to that end.”&#160;&#160;<i>City of Boerne</i>, 521 U.&#160;S., at&#160;<br/>520.&#160;&#160;Neither we nor the respondents are aware&#160;of any other<br/>legislation&#160;by Congress&#160;to enforce&#160;Section 3. &#160;See Tr. of Oral&#160;<br/>Arg. 123.<br/>
Any state enforcement of Section 3&#160;against federal office-<br/>
holders and candidates,&#160;though, would not derive from Sec-<br/>tion 5, which confers power only on “[t]he Congress.” &#160;As a&#160;<br/>result, such state enforcement might be argued to sweep<br/>more broadly than congressional enforcement could under<br/>our precedents.&#160;&#160;But the notion that the Constitution grants&#160;<br/>the States freer rein than Congress to decide how Section 3<br/>should be enforced with respect&#160;to federal offices is simply<br/>implausible.<br/>
Finally, state enforcement of&#160;Section 3 with respect to the<br/>
Presidency would raise heightened&#160;concerns. &#160;“[I]n the con-<br/>text of a Presidential&#160;election, state-imposed restrictions<br/>implicate a uniquely important national interest.” &#160;<i>Ander-<br/>son</i>&#160;v.&#160;<i>Celebrezze</i>, 460 U.&#160;S. 780, 794–795 (1983) (footnote&#160;<br/>omitted).&#160;&#160;But state-by-state resolution of&#160;the question<br/>whether Section 3 bars a particular candidate for President&#160;<br/>from serving would be&#160;quite unlikely to yield&#160;a uniform an-<br/>swer consistent with the basic&#160;principle that “the President&#160;<br/>. . .&#160;represent[s]&#160;<i>all&#160;</i>the voters in&#160;the Nation.” &#160;<i>Id.</i>, at 795&#160;<br/>(emphasis added).<br/>
Conflicting&#160;state outcomes concerning the same candi-<br/>
date could result not just from&#160;differing views of the merits,&#160;<br/>but from variations in state law governing the&#160;proceedings<br/>that are necessary to make Section&#160;3 disqualification deter-<br/>minations.&#160;&#160;Some States&#160;might allow a Section 3 challenge&#160;<br/>to succeed based on a preponderance of the evidence, while&#160;<br/>

others might require a heightened showing.&#160;&#160;Certain evi-<br/>dence (like the congressional Report on which the lower<br/>courts relied here) might be admissible&#160;in some&#160;States but&#160;<br/>inadmissible hearsay in others.&#160;&#160;Disqualification might be<br/>possible only through criminal prosecution, as opposed to<br/>expedited civil proceedings, in&#160;particular States. &#160;Indeed, in&#160;<br/>some States—unlike Colorado (or&#160;Maine, where the secre-<br/>tary of state&#160;recently issued an order excluding&#160;former Pres-<br/>ident Trump from the&#160;primary ballot)—procedures for ex-<br/>cluding an ineligible&#160;candidate from the ballot may not&#160;<br/>exist at all.&#160;&#160;The result could&#160;well be that a single candidate&#160;<br/>would be declared ineligible in&#160;some&#160;States, but not others,<br/>based on the same conduct (and&#160;perhaps even the same fac-<br/>tual record).<br/>
The “patchwork” that would likely result from state en-<br/>
forcement would “sever the direct link that the Framers&#160;<br/>found so critical between the National Government and the&#160;<br/>people of the United States” as a&#160;whole. &#160;<i>U.&#160;S. Term&#160;Limits</i>,&#160;<br/>514 U.&#160;S., at 822. &#160;But in a Presidential election “the impact<br/>of the votes&#160;cast in each&#160;State is affected by the votes cast”—<br/>or, in this case, the votes not&#160;allowed to be cast—“for the&#160;<br/>various candidates in other States.”&#160;&#160;<i>Anderson</i>, 460 U.&#160;S.,&#160;<br/>at 795.&#160;&#160;An evolving electoral&#160;map could dramatically&#160;<br/>change the behavior of&#160;voters, parties, and States across the&#160;<br/>country, in&#160;different ways and at&#160;different times. &#160;The dis-<br/>ruption would be all the more acute—and could nullify the&#160;<br/>votes of millions and change the election result—if Section<br/>3 enforcement were attempted after the Nation has voted.<br/>Nothing in the Constitution requires that we endure such<br/>chaos—arriving at any time&#160;or different times, up to and&#160;<br/>perhaps beyond the Inauguration.&#160;<br/>

All nine Members of the Court agree with that result.<br/>
Our colleagues writing&#160;separately further agree with many<br/>of the reasons this&#160;opinion provides for reaching it. &#160;See&#160;<br/><i>post</i>, Part&#160;I (joint opinion of SOTOMAYOR,&#160;&#160;KAGAN,&#160;&#160;and&#160;<br/>JACKSON, JJ.); see also&#160;<i>post</i>, p.&#160;1 (opinion of&#160;BARRETT, J.).<br/>So far as&#160;we can tell, they object only to our&#160;taking into ac-<br/>count the distinctive way Section 3 works and the fact that&#160;<br/>Section 5 vests&#160;<i>in Congress</i>&#160;the power to enforce it. &#160;These&#160;<br/>are not the only reasons the States lack power to enforce<br/>this particular constitutional&#160;provision with respect to fed-<br/>eral offices.&#160;&#160;But they are important ones, and it is the com-<br/>bination of&#160;all the reasons set forth in this&#160;opinion—not,&#160;as<br/>some&#160;of our&#160;colleagues&#160;would have it, just one&#160;particular ra-<br/>tionale—that resolves this case.&#160;&#160;In our view,&#160;each of these&#160;<br/>reasons is&#160;necessary to provide a&#160;complete explanation for&#160;<br/>the judgment the Court unanimously reaches.&#160;<br/>

JUSTICE&#160;BARRETT,&#160;concurring in part and&#160;concurring in&#160;<br/>
the judgment.&#160;<br/>
I join Parts&#160;I and II–B of the Court’s opinion. &#160;I agree that<br/>
States lack&#160;the power to enforce Section 3 against Presiden-<br/>tial candidates. &#160;That&#160;principle is sufficient to&#160;resolve this&#160;<br/>case, and I&#160;would decide no more than that.&#160;&#160;This suit was&#160;<br/>brought by Colorado voters under&#160;state law in&#160;state court.<br/>It does not&#160;require us to address the complicated question<br/>whether federal legislation is the&#160;exclusive vehicle through<br/>which Section 3 can be&#160;enforced.&#160;<br/>
The majority’s choice&#160;of a different path leaves the re-<br/>
maining Justices with a choice of&#160;how to respond. &#160;In my<br/>judgment, this is not the time to amplify disagreement with&#160;<br/>stridency.&#160;&#160;The Court has settled a politically charged issue<br/>in the volatile season of a Presidential election.&#160;&#160;Particu-<br/>larly in this&#160;circumstance, writings on the&#160;Court should&#160;<br/>turn the national temperature down, not up. &#160;For present&#160;<br/>purposes, our differences are far less important than our&#160;<br/>unanimity: All nine Justices agree on the outcome of this&#160;<br/>case.&#160;&#160;That is the message Americans should&#160;take home.&#160;<br/>

“If it is not&#160;necessary to&#160;decide more to dispose of a case,<br/>
then it is necessary&#160;<i>not&#160;</i>to decide more.”&#160;&#160;<i>Dobbs</i>&#160;v.&#160;<i>Jackson&#160;<br/>Women’s Health&#160;Organization</i>, 597 U.&#160;S. 215, 348 (2022)&#160;<br/>(ROBERTS, C.&#160;J., concurring in judgment). &#160;That fundamen-<br/>tal principle of judicial restraint is&#160;practically&#160;as old as our<br/>Republic.&#160;&#160;This Court is authorized “to say what the law is”<br/>only because “[t]hose who apply [a] rule to particular cases&#160;<br/>. . .&#160;&#160;must&#160;&#160;of&#160;&#160;<i>necessity&#160;&#160;</i>expound and interpret that rule.”&#160;<br/><i>Marbury&#160;</i>v.&#160;<i>Madison</i>, 1&#160;Cranch&#160;137, 177 (1803) (emphasis&#160;<br/>added).<br/>
Today, the&#160;Court departs from that vital principle, decid-<br/>
ing not just this case, but challenges that might arise in the<br/>future.&#160;&#160;In&#160;this case, the Court must decide&#160;whether Colo-<br/>rado may keep a&#160;Presidential candidate off the&#160;ballot on&#160;the<br/>ground that&#160;he is an oathbreaking insurrectionist and thus<br/>disqualified&#160;from holding federal office under Section 3 of&#160;<br/>the Fourteenth Amendment. &#160;Allowing Colorado to do so&#160;<br/>would, we agree, create a chaotic state-by-state&#160;patchwork,<br/>at odds&#160;with our Nation’s federalism principles. &#160;That is&#160;<br/>enough to resolve this&#160;case. &#160;Yet the majority&#160;goes further.<br/>Even though “[a]ll nine Members of the Court” agree that<br/>this independent and sufficient rationale resolves this case,&#160;<br/>

five Justices go on.&#160;&#160;They decide novel constitutional ques-<br/>tions to insulate this Court and&#160;petitioner from future con-<br/>troversy.&#160;&#160;<i>Ante,</i>&#160;at&#160;13.&#160;&#160;Although only an individual State’s<br/>action is at&#160;issue here, the majority&#160;opines on which federal&#160;<br/>actors can enforce Section 3, and how they must do so. &#160;The&#160;<br/>majority announces that a disqualification for insurrection&#160;<br/>can occur only when Congress enacts a particular kind of<br/>legislation&#160;pursuant to&#160;Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amend-<br/>ment.&#160;&#160;In doing so, the&#160;majority shuts the door on other po-<br/>tential means of federal enforcement.&#160;&#160;We cannot join an&#160;<br/>opinion that decides momentous and difficult&#160;issues unnec-<br/>essarily, and we therefore concur only in the judgment.&#160;<br/>
I&#160;<br/>
Our Constitution leaves some questions to the States<br/>
while committing others to&#160;the Federal Government. &#160;Fed-<br/>eralism principles embedded in that constitutional struc-<br/>ture&#160;decide this&#160;case.&#160;&#160;States&#160;cannot use their control over&#160;<br/>the ballot&#160;to “undermine the National Government.” &#160;<i>U. S.&#160;<br/>Term&#160;Limits, Inc.</i>&#160;v.&#160;<i>Thornton</i>, 514 U.&#160;S. 779,&#160;810 (1995).<br/>That danger is even&#160;greater “in the&#160;context of a&#160;Presidential&#160;<br/>election.”&#160;&#160;<i>Anderson&#160;</i>v.&#160;<i>Celebrezze</i>,&#160;460 U.&#160;S.&#160;780, 794–795&#160;<br/>(1983).&#160;&#160;State restrictions in that&#160;context “implicate a<br/>uniquely important national interest” extending beyond a&#160;<br/>State’s “own&#160;borders.” &#160;<i>Ibid.&#160;&#160;</i>No doubt, States&#160;have signifi-<br/>cant “authority over presidential electors” and, in turn,&#160;<br/>Presidential elections.&#160;&#160;<i>Chiafalo&#160;</i>v.&#160;&#160;<i>Washington</i>, 591 U.&#160;S.&#160;<br/>578, 588 (2020).&#160;&#160;That power, however, is limited by “other<br/>constitutional constraint[s],”&#160;including federalism princi-<br/>ples.&#160;&#160;<i>Id</i>., at&#160;589.&#160;<br/>
The majority rests on such principles when it explains<br/>
why&#160;Colorado cannot take Petitioner off the ballot. &#160;“[S]tate-<br/>by-state resolution of the question whether Section 3 bars&#160;a&#160;<br/>particular candidate for President from serving,” the major-<br/>ity explains, “would be quite unlikely to yield a uniform an-<br/>swer consistent with the basic principle that ‘the President&#160;<br/>

. . .&#160;represent[s]&#160;<i>all&#160;</i>the voters in the Nation.’” &#160;<i>Ante</i>, at&#160;11&#160;<br/>(quoting&#160;<i>Anderson</i>, 460&#160;U.&#160;S., at 795). &#160;That is&#160;especially so,&#160;<br/>the majority adds, because different States can&#160;reach “[c]on-<br/>flicting&#160;. . .&#160;outcomes&#160;concerning&#160;the same candidate .&#160;.&#160;. not&#160;<br/>just from differing views of the merits, but from variations<br/>in state law governing&#160;the proceedings” to enforce Section<br/>3.&#160;&#160;<i>Ante</i>, at&#160;11<i>.&#160;</i><br/>
The contrary conclusion that a handful of officials in a&#160;<br/>
few States&#160;could decide the Nation’s next President would&#160;<br/>be especially surprising with&#160;respect to Section 3. &#160;The&#160;Re-<br/>construction Amendments “were specifically designed as an&#160;<br/>expansion of federal power and an&#160;intrusion on state sover-<br/>eignty.”&#160;&#160;<i>City of Rome</i>&#160;v.&#160;<i>United States</i>, 446 U.&#160;S. 156, 179&#160;<br/>(1980).&#160;&#160;Section 3 marked the first time the&#160;Constitution&#160;<br/>placed substantive limits on&#160;a State’s authority to choose&#160;<br/>its own officials.&#160;&#160;Given&#160;that context, it would defy logic for&#160;<br/>Section 3 to give States new&#160;powers to determine who may<br/>hold the Presidency.&#160;&#160;Cf.&#160;<i>ante</i>, at&#160;8 (“It would be incongru-<br/>ous to read this particular Amendment as granting the<br/>States the power—silently no less—to disqualify a candi-<br/>date for federal office”).<br/>
That provides a secure and sufficient basis to resolve this&#160;<br/>
case.&#160;&#160;To allow Colorado to take a presidential candidate off<br/>the ballot under Section 3 would imperil the&#160;Framers’ vi-<br/>sion of “a Federal Government&#160;directly responsible to the<br/>people.”&#160;&#160;<i>U.&#160;S. Term Limits</i>, 514 U.&#160;S., at 821. &#160;The Court&#160;<br/>should have started and ended its&#160;opinion with this conclu-<br/>sion.&#160;<br/>
II&#160;<br/>
Yet the Court continues&#160;on to&#160;resolve questions&#160;not before&#160;<br/>
us.&#160;&#160;In a&#160;case involving no&#160;federal action whatsoever, the<br/>Court opines on&#160;how federal enforcement of&#160;Section 3 must<br/>proceed.&#160;&#160;Congress, the majority&#160;says, must&#160;enact legisla-<br/>tion under&#160;Section 5 prescribing the procedures&#160;to “&#160;‘&#160;“ascer-<br/>tain[] what&#160;particular individuals”&#160;’&#160;” should be&#160;disqualified.&#160;<br/>

SOTOMAYOR,&#160;KAGAN,&#160;and&#160;JACKSON,&#160;JJ., concurring&#160;in judgment&#160;<br/>
<i>Ante</i>, at 5&#160;(quoting&#160;<i>Griffin’s Case</i>, 11 F.&#160;Cas. 7, 26&#160;<br/>(No. 5,815) (CC Va.&#160;1869) (Chase, Circuit Justice)). &#160;These&#160;<br/>musings are as inadequately supported as they are gratui-<br/>tous.&#160;<br/>
To start, nothing in Section&#160;3’s text supports&#160;the major-<br/>
ity’s&#160;view of&#160;how federal disqualification efforts must oper-<br/>ate.&#160;&#160;Section 3 states simply that “[n]o person shall” hold&#160;<br/>certain positions and offices if they&#160;are oathbreaking insur-<br/>rectionists.&#160;&#160;Amdt. 14.&#160;&#160;Nothing in that unequivocal bar sug-<br/>gests that implementing legislation enacted under Section&#160;<br/>5 is “critical” (or, for that matter, what that&#160;word means in&#160;<br/>this context). &#160;<i>Ante</i>, at 5.&#160;&#160;In fact, the text cuts&#160;the opposite&#160;<br/>way.&#160;&#160;Section 3 provides&#160;that&#160;when an oathbreaking insur-<br/>rectionist is disqualified, “Congress may by&#160;a&#160;vote of two-<br/>thirds of each House, remove such&#160;disability.”&#160;&#160;It is&#160;hard to&#160;<br/>understand why the Constitution&#160;would require a congres-<br/>sional supermajority to&#160;remove a disqualification if a simple<br/>majority could nullify&#160;Section 3’s operation by&#160;repealing or&#160;<br/>declining to pass implementing legislation.&#160;&#160;Even peti-<br/>tioner’s lawyer acknowledged the “tension” in Section 3 that&#160;<br/>the majority’s view creates.&#160;&#160;See Tr. of Oral Arg. 31.<br/>
Similarly, nothing else in the rest of the Fourteenth<br/>
Amendment supports the majority’s view.&#160;&#160;Section 5 gives&#160;<br/>Congress the “power&#160;to&#160;enforce&#160;[the Amendment] by appro-<br/>priate legislation.” &#160;Remedial&#160;legislation of&#160;any kind, how-<br/>ever, is not&#160;required. &#160;All the Reconstruction Amendments&#160;<br/>(including the due process and&#160;equal protection guarantees&#160;<br/>and prohibition of slavery) “are self-executing,” meaning&#160;<br/>that they do not depend&#160;on legislation. &#160;<i>City of&#160;Boerne</i>&#160;v.&#160;<br/><i>Flores</i>, 521&#160;U.&#160;S. 507, 524 (1997); see&#160;<i>Civil Rights&#160;Cases</i>,&#160;109&#160;<br/>U.&#160;S. 3, 20&#160;(1883). &#160;Similarly,&#160;other constitutional rules&#160;of&#160;<br/>disqualification, like the two-term limit on the Presidency,&#160;<br/>do not require implementing legislation. &#160;See,&#160;<i>e</i>.<i>g</i>., Art. II,&#160;<br/>§1, cl.&#160;5 (Presidential&#160;Qualifications); Amdt.&#160;22 (Presiden-<br/>tial Term Limits).&#160;&#160;Nor does the majority suggest otherwise.&#160;<br/>

It simply creates a special rule for&#160;the insurrection disabil-<br/>ity in Section 3.<br/>
The majority is left with next to no&#160;support for its require-<br/>
ment that a&#160;Section 3 disqualification can occur only pursu-<br/>ant to legislation enacted for that purpose.&#160;&#160;It cites&#160;<i>Griffin’s&#160;<br/>Case</i>,&#160;but&#160;that is a nonprecedential, lower court opinion by<br/>a single Justice in his capacity as a circuit judge.&#160;&#160;See&#160;<i>ante</i>,&#160;<br/>at&#160;&#160;5 (quoting 11 F.&#160;Cas., at 26).&#160;&#160;Once&#160;again,&#160;even&#160;peti-<br/>tioner’s lawyer distanced himself from fully embracing this&#160;<br/>case as probative of Section 3’s meaning.&#160;&#160;See Tr. of Oral&#160;<br/>Arg. 35–36.&#160;&#160;The majority also cites Senator Trumbull’s<br/>statements that Section&#160;3 “&#160;‘provide[d] no means for enforc-<br/>ing’&#160;” itself. &#160;<i>Ante</i>, at 5&#160;(quoting&#160;Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 1st&#160;<br/>Sess., 626 (1869)). &#160;The majority, however, neglects to men-<br/>tion the Senator’s view that “[i]t is the&#160;[F]ourteenth<br/>[A]mendment that prevents a person from holding office,”&#160;<br/>with the&#160;proposed legislation simply “affor[ding] a more ef-<br/>ficient and speedy remedy” for effecting the&#160;disqualifica-<br/>tion.&#160;&#160;Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 1st Sess., at 626–627.&#160;<br/>
Ultimately, under the guise of providing a more “com-<br/>
plete explanation for the judgment,”&#160;<i>ante,</i>&#160;at&#160;13, the major-<br/>ity resolves many unsettled questions about Section 3.&#160;&#160;It&#160;<br/>forecloses judicial enforcement of&#160;that provision, such as&#160;<br/>might occur&#160;when a party is prosecuted by an&#160;insurrection-<br/>ist and raises a defense on that score.&#160;&#160;The majority further<br/>holds that&#160;any legislation to enforce this provision must&#160;<br/>prescribe certain procedures “&#160;‘tailor[ed]’&#160;” to&#160;Section 3,&#160;<i>ante,&#160;<br/></i>at 10, ruling out enforcement under general federal stat-<br/>utes requiring the government to comply with the law.&#160;&#160;By<br/>resolving these and other questions, the majority attempts<br/>to insulate all alleged insurrectionists from future chal-<br/>lenges to their holding&#160;federal office.&#160;<br/>

SOTOMAYOR,&#160;KAGAN,&#160;and&#160;JACKSON,&#160;JJ., concurring&#160;in judgment&#160;<br/>
<i>Bush&#160;</i>v.&#160;<i>Gore</i>, 531 U.&#160;S.&#160;98, 158 (2000) (Breyer,&#160;J., dissent-<br/>ing).&#160;&#160;The&#160;Court today&#160;needed to resolve only a single ques-<br/>tion: whether an individual State&#160;may&#160;keep a Presidential&#160;<br/>candidate found to have engaged in insurrection off its bal-<br/>lot.&#160;&#160;The majority&#160;resolves much more than the case before&#160;<br/>us.&#160;&#160;Although federal enforcement&#160;of&#160;Section&#160;3&#160;is&#160;in&#160;no&#160;way<br/>at issue,&#160;the majority announces&#160;novel rules&#160;for how that&#160;<br/>enforcement must operate. &#160;It reaches out to decide Section&#160;<br/>3 questions&#160;not before&#160;us, and to&#160;foreclose future efforts to&#160;<br/>disqualify a&#160;Presidential candidate under that provision. &#160;In&#160;<br/>a sensitive case crying out for judicial restraint, it abandons&#160;<br/>that course.&#160;<br/>
Section 3 serves an important, though rarely needed, role<br/>
in our democracy. &#160;The&#160;American people&#160;have the power to&#160;<br/>vote for and&#160;elect candidates for national office, and that is&#160;<br/>a great and glorious thing. &#160;The men who drafted and&#160;rati-<br/>fied the Fourteenth Amendment, however, had witnessed&#160;<br/>an “insurrection [and] rebellion” to defend slavery.&#160;&#160;§3.<br/>They wanted&#160;to ensure that those who had participated in<br/>that insurrection, and in possible future insurrections,&#160;<br/>could not return to prominent&#160;roles. &#160;Today,&#160;the majority<br/>goes beyond the necessities of this case to limit how Section<br/>3 can bar an oathbreaking insurrectionist from becoming<br/>President.&#160;&#160;Although we agree that Colorado cannot enforce<br/>Section 3, we protest the majority’s&#160;effort to use this case to<br/>define the limits of federal enforcement of that provision.&#160;<br/>Because we&#160;would decide only the issue before us, we concur&#160;<br/>only in the judgment.&#160;<br/>
