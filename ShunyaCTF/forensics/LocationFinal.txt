Listen up, you sorry bunch of losers. You think you're hot stuff just 'cause you're in my city now? Well, think again, 'cause you're about to get a taste of my wrath.
	    	      	 	  		      	      	     	    
Yeah, you found out who I am. Big whoop. But let me tell you something â€“ I'm not just playing games here. I'm out for blood. Dr. Kumar messed with me for way too long, and now it's payback time. And guess what? You're not gonna stop me.
       	    	  	     	 	   	    		       	 
I've got Dr. Kumar stashed away somewhere real nice, right under your noses, in this bustling city teeming with people. Good luck finding him in this sea of humanity. And while you're running around like headless chickens, I'm gonna be laughing all the way to the bank, cashing in on his secrets.
  	    	  	  	  	       	      	       		    
You think you're tough? Ha! You ain't seen nothing yet. I'm gonna make you regret ever crossing paths with me. Every move you make, I'll be one step ahead, laughing at your pathetic attempts to stop me.
   	     		     	     	  		     	 	    
So, bring it on, suckers. But just know, you're in way over your heads. Dr. Kumar's mine, and there's nothing you can do about it.
 	      	   	 		   	    	   	      	       
Enjoy the chase!
